## Prerequisite installation

    1. Python3 
    2. Tkinter (GUI package)
    3. CVXPY (a Python-embedded language for convex optimization problems)
    4. Microsoft Z3 Solver [Optional] (only needed for running Z3 version)

## Layout

The project has the following file layout:

    README.md
    API_ORCSolver.pdf
    Code/
      ORCSolver (Ours)/
      PureBranch&Bound/
      PureZ3/
      QPforFlows/
      images/

The `API_ORCSolver.pdf` includes the API of ORCSolver which can be used to specify layouts. Our API allows us to plug in different solvers for different ORC patterns (including `**ORCSolver(Ours)**`, `QP for Flows`, and `Pure Branch & Bound`). 

The `Code` folder contains all the source code for all the four methods as mentioned in the paper (`**ORCSolver(Ours)**`, `Pure Z3`, `QP for Flows`, `Pure Branch & Bound`). We also provide sample code for some layout patterns and the code generating examples in our teaser and video.
